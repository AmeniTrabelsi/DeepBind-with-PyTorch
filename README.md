# DeepBind-with-PyTorch

This repository contains a PyTorch implementation of a DeepBind model that came out in 2015. I implemented the model described in the paper ["Predicting the sequence specificities of DNA and RNA-binding proteins by deep learning"](https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.3300) with the use of Pytorch.
